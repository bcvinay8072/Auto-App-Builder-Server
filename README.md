# Auto App Builder — Server

A lightweight, modular backend for the Auto-App-Builder project. This repository provides the server-side API and tooling used to scaffold, generate and orchestrate app projects created by the Auto-App-Builder system. It's written in JavaScript and intended to be a straightforward, easy-to-run Node.js service that can be extended to integrate with template engines, third-party APIs (e.g., OpenAI, cloud storage) and CI/CD pipelines.

> NOTE: This README is a descriptive and practical starting point. Adapt environment variables, endpoints and examples to match the actual implementation in the codebase.

## Features

- Minimal RESTful API to manage app scaffolding and generation requests
- Pluggable template and scaffolding system (design to be extended)
- Support for integrating external services (OpenAI, cloud storage, build services)
- Environment-driven configuration for deployment flexibility
- Intended to be lightweight and easy to run locally or inside containers

---

## Tech stack

- Node.js (JavaScript)
- Express (or similar) for REST API
- Optional: Integration with cloud object stores (S3, GCS), databases, or AI APIs
- Testing: Jest / Mocha (recommended)
- CI: GitHub Actions (recommended)

---

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- npm or yarn
- (Optional) Docker & Docker Compose if you prefer containerized runs

### Install

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bcvinay8072/Auto-App-Builder-Server.git
cd Auto-App-Builder-Server
npm install
```

(or use yarn)

### Environment variables

This server is configured via environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project root (or supply variables via your deployment system).

Suggested variables (adjust to your implementation):

- PORT — HTTP port (default 3000)
- NODE_ENV — development | production
- DATABASE_URL — database connection string (if using a DB)
- JWT_SECRET — signing secret for tokens (if auth is needed)
- OPENAI_API_KEY — (optional) API key for OpenAI integration
- STORAGE_PROVIDER — e.g., s3 | local
- S3_BUCKET / S3_REGION / S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID / S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY — for S3 storage
- LOG_LEVEL — debug | info | warn | error

See the next section for a sample `.env`.

### Run

Development:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
node src/index.js
```

Production:

```bash
npm run start
```

If your repo includes scripts, replace the above commands with the ones in package.json.

---

## Configuration example (.env)

Example .env (copy to `.env` and customize values):

```
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/autoapp
JWT_SECRET=replace_with_a_secure_random_string
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxx
STORAGE_PROVIDER=local
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

---

## API (example endpoints)

Below are example endpoints you might expect in this server. Treat these as suggestions to match code in this repo — update them to reflect the actual routes and payloads.

- POST /api/v1/generate
  - Start a new app generation job using templates and a user prompt.
  - Body (example):
    ```json
    {
      "projectName": "MyAwesomeApp",
      "template": "react-starter",
      "config": { "useAuth": true, "database": "postgres" },
      "prompt": "Create a TODO app with authentication"
    }
    ```
  - Response: 202 Accepted with job id

- GET /api/v1/jobs/:id
  - Get job status and logs for a generation task.

- GET /api/v1/templates
  - List available templates and details.

- POST /api/v1/templates
  - Upload or register a new template (admin-only).

- GET /api/v1/projects/:id/download
  - Download generated project as a zip (or S3 URL).

Authentication and authorization endpoints (if implemented) should live under /api/v1/auth.

Example curl request to start a generation job:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"projectName":"demo","template":"node-api","prompt":"A simple notes API"}'
```

---

## Development notes & recommended workflows

- Keep business logic modular: separate template resolution, scaffolding, and I/O (disk, S3).
- Use job queues (BullMQ, Bee-Queue, or native background workers) for long-running generation tasks.
- Add structured logging (pino or winston) and centralized error handling.
- Persist generation metadata and logs to a DB or storage for auditability.
- Consider rate-limiting and request validation for public endpoints.

---

## Testing

- Add unit tests for template processing and file generation functions.
- Add integration tests for the HTTP endpoints (supertest) and for any external service integrations using test doubles/mocks.
- Example test command (if tests are included in package.json):

```bash
npm test
```

---

## Docker (optional)

You can containerize the server with a simple Dockerfile (example):

Dockerfile (example)
```
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
ENV NODE_ENV=production
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

Adjust build steps depending on whether your repo uses transpilation (TypeScript/Babel).

---

## Deployment

- Deploy as a standard Node.js app (Heroku, Render, Fly, DigitalOcean App Platform).
- For production workloads, run behind a process manager (PM2) or container orchestrator (Kubernetes).
- Use a managed object store for serving generated artifacts (S3, GCS) and a CDN for fast downloads.

## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing! A suggested workflow:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feat/your-feature
3. Implement and test your changes
4. Open a pull request describing your changes

Add a CONTRIBUTING.md and code of conduct to formalize the process if needed.

---

## Roadmap ideas

- First-class template marketplace and template versioning
- WebSocket-based real-time job logs
- Multi-tenant or workspace support
- Automatic CI integration for generated projects
- Visual project preview and build-on-demand

---

## Troubleshooting

- If generation jobs fail:
  - Check server logs for stack traces
  - Verify external API keys (OpenAI, S3) are present and valid
  - Ensure file system permissions and disk space are sufficient
- If downloads fail:
  - Validate signed URL generation or storage provider configuration
